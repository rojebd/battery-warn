# Battery Warn

Simple rust program I run in the background to warn me when my battery is high enough or too low.
This script just runs in the background rechecking the battery percentage every 5 minutes.

If you also want to use this you need [fyi](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fyi) to send notifications
and also rust installed to compile it.

After that you can just execute the program on startup and it just runs in a loop.
